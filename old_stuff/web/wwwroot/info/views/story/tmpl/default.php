<h1>Story</h1>
<p>Humanity went to colonise far-away planets.&nbsp;
   After centuries of stasis, the colony ships were pulled off course and escape pods were launched.&nbsp;
   No-one knows what happened, but the survivors find themselves scattered across many worlds, each with an ominous dark vortex at the heart of its largest continent.&nbsp;
   From the vortex come strange creatures intent on capturing any life they can find and transporting it through the vortex to a fate we cannot imagine.</p>
